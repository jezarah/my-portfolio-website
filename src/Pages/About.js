                            I'm a Software Developer based in

                            Dedicated to creating functional, responsive, and aesthetic full stack web and mobile applications.
                            My aptitude for analytical problem solving is what pushed me to pursue my first degree in Engineering,
                            but I found my passion for coding and software development due to the unique combination of creativity,
                            logic, and the inherently dynamic innovation of the technology field. I'm a lifelong learner and committed
                            to seeking opportunities for growth and personal development.
