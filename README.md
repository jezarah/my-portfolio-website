# My Portfolio Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and showcases my project work to date. Note that this repository may not be the most up to date version of this portfolio ([jezziecodes.com](https://www.jezziecodes.com/)), as I actively make updates and use GitLab for version control and deployment.
